summary: |
  A queer mythology
  written on 250 index cards --
  **Riding SideSaddle\***
  follows a cast of friends as they navigate
  fluid genders & relationships
  with bodies that resist order, category, or completion.
  It's a story chosen family,
  inspired by the life of Margaret Clap
  and the many myths of Hermaphroditus.
